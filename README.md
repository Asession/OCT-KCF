## Output Constraint Transfer for Kernelized Correlation Filter in Tracking

________________

This is a MATLAB implementation of algorithm presented in "Output Constraint Transfer for Kernelized Correlation Filter in Tracking" paper[1]. The implementation is built upon the code provided by [2]. The code provided by [3] is used for computing the HOG features.


________________
Instructions:
1) Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB.
2) Choose sequence (only "Jogging-1" is included).
